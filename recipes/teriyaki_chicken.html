    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Teriyaki chicken is a mouthwatering and popular Japanese dish that combines tender pieces of chicken with a sweet and savory teriyaki sauce. The key characteristics of teriyaki chicken are its glossy, caramelized glaze and its irresistible flavor profile.</p>
        <p>To make teriyaki chicken, boneless chicken pieces, often chicken breast or thigh, are marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, sake or white wine, sugar, and sometimes mirin (a sweet rice wine). The marinating process infuses the chicken with the flavors of the sauce, giving it a delightful umami richness.</p>
        <p>Once marinated, the chicken is typically pan-fried, grilled, or broiled until it's cooked through and slightly charred on the edges. During the cooking process, the teriyaki sauce caramelizes, forming a sticky and glossy coating on the chicken. This sauce strikes a perfect balance between salty and sweet, with a hint of smokiness from the grilling or searing.</p>
        <p>The result is tender, succulent chicken pieces that are bursting with savory and sweet notes, making teriyaki chicken a tantalizing combination of flavors and textures. It's often served over a bed of steamed white rice or alongside vegetables, creating a satisfying and harmonious meal that appeals to a wide range of palates. Teriyaki chicken embodies the essence of Japanese cuisine's ability to beautifully meld contrasting tastes into a delightful and harmonious dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Brown sugar</li>
            <li>Low sodium soy sauce or tamari </li>
            <li>Honey</li>
            <li>Ground ginger</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>White Rice</li>
            <li>Broccoli</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat some oil in a pan until it is glistening, then add the chicken (you can use chicken thighs or breasts–whichever you prefer!) and cook 3-4 minutes per side. Pro tip: do not move the chicken while it cooks (it’s tempting, but just let it get nice and brown!)</li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, you can quickly prepare the teriyaki sauce in a small bowl. Stir the cornstarch and cold water together until the cornstarch dissolves. Then whisk in the brown sugar, soy sauce, honey, ginger, and garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is done, add the sauce to the pan and bring the sauce to a simmer over medium-high heat. You’ll reduce the heat to medium low and cook until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>To serve, divide the rice between bowls and top with the chicken and pour the sauce from the pan over everything.</li>
            <li>Garnish with sesame seeds and green onions, if using, before serving. Some folks like to serve broccoli with this, and we recommend checking out our article about How To Steam Broccoli if you take that route.</li>
