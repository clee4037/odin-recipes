This iconic drink dates back to the early 19th century and remains a cherished favorite among cocktail enthusiasts. Made with just a few key ingredients, including bourbon or rye whiskey, a sugar cube, Angostura bitters, and a twist of orange or lemon peel, it's a drink that celebrates the pure, unadulterated essence of whiskey.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 oz (60 ml) Bourbon or Rye Whiskey</li>
            <li>1 Sugar Cube</li>
            <li>2-3 dashes of Angostura Bitters</li>
            <li>Orange or Lemon Peel (for garnish)</li>
            <li>Ice</li>
            <li>Optional: Maraschino cherry for garnish (traditional, but some prefer without)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by placing the sugar cube at the bottom of an Old Fashioned glass (also known as a rocks glass).</li>
            <li>Add 2-3 dashes of Angostura Bitters directly onto the sugar cube. The bitters will help mellow the sweetness and add complexity to the drink.</li>
            <li>Using a muddler or the back of a spoon, gently muddle the sugar cube and bitters together. The goal is to dissolve the sugar and create a syrupy consistency.</li>
            <li>Fill the glass with ice cubes. You can use a large ice cube or several smaller ones, depending on your preference.</li>
            <li>Pour the 2 oz of Bourbon or Rye Whiskey over the ice.</li>
            <li>Stir the cocktail gently for about 20-30 seconds to chill and mix the ingredients. Stirring helps to dilute the drink slightly and ensures even distribution of flavors.</li>
            <li>Take a piece of orange or lemon peel and twist it over the drink to release its essential oils. You can also run the peel around the rim of the glass for added aroma.</li>
            <li>Optionally, garnish the cocktail with a Maraschino cherry by placing it on a cocktail pick and resting it on the ice.</li>
            <li>Your Old Fashioned cocktail is now ready to be enjoyed. Sip it slowly to savor the rich, balanced flavors.</li>
        </ol>
